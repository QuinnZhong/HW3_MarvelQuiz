## HW3 Assignment Description

Pick a minimum of three and a maximum of five Marvel characters. Store the character names in an array or list. Create an interactive quiz using and storing text inputs; figure out which Marvel character is the “answer”.
Create a series of at least 4 questions that will describe a given character (wiithout being too obvious) - ex you male? Female? Neither? etc. Are you from Earth? Do you have super powers? and so on.
Figure out a points system that corresponds to those characters in your list or array, and then print out the quiz answer using variables.
Create a roadmap and programming path (Google Drive doc) to help you work through the problem and solve it using small, achievable steps.
Explore some Python “pieces” that we haven’t looked at yet - as an example, the dictionary might come in handy when building the quiz. You could use this to store your questions, the points for each question, etc.
Use functions where you can. Store your functions and variables as components in an external folder and import them into your main file.
Track your progress in this document and mark completion as you go.
Create a well-written readme file and branches as necessary, following workflow as demonstrated in class. Use pull requests and merge as you go.
